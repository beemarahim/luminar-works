            <h2 class="heading">Rain Rising</h2>
            <p>We watch a sensitive poet grapple with her physical universe
                as also with ancestry and roots and the search
                for roots...The raw material,
                as also the way she handles it are the essence of poetry.
                - Keki N. Daruwalla</p>
